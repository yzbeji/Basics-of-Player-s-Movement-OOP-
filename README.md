# Basics-of-Player-s-Movement-OOP

This is a simple project where I try to implement the basics of Object Oriented Programming in Javascript. It is a related on a animated character that moves in four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (with the arrow keys). You can just the copy-paste the code and open a live server and move on the black screen where you want to. You can't cross the width or height of the webpage. This is just the beginning in developing a simple 2D RPG game.
